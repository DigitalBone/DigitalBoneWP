including three high school pupils and a teacher â€“ died when a man believed to be an unlicensed taxi tout, lost control of an overloaded minibus near Sterkspruit before it plunged 200m down an embankment.</P>\\r\\n<P>Twelve others were seriously injured in the horror smash, which happened on Saturday morning at the sharp Mmusong bend near Telle Bridge on the Lesotho border.<BR>â€œThe driver lost control and the vehicle overturned and rolled more than 200m down an embankment,â€ Arrive Alive provincial spokesman Tshepo Machaea said.<BR>Passengers were flung through the windows. The nine victims died at the scene. Rescue workers had struggled for almost eight hours to bring the bodies up the embankment, Machaea said.<BR>Of the 12 injured, two patients were taken to Frere Hospital in East London. They are Tlokweng High School Grade 11 pupil Moratepedi Tsekedi and Tlokweng teacher Khaliphile Dubule. The rest are being treated at Sterkspruitâ€™s Mpilisweni Hospital.</P>\\r\\n<P>Machaea said although the taxi was certified to carry only 15 passengers, 21 people had been in it at the time of the smash.<BR>Both Machaea and Public Works MEC Pemmy Majodina, who flew to the accident scene by helicopter, said the minibus had been contracted to transport pupils to Tlokweng High School.<BR>â€œBut the driver apparently decided to load other people as well to take them to town,â€ an angry Majodina said. Some were Grade 11 students on their way to write exams, while others were going to attend extra classes.</P>\\r\\n<P>Both Machaea and Majodina said it was believed the 23-year-old driver did not have a licence and was not authorised to drive the taxi. Police are investigating why the man, believed to be a â€œtoutâ€ was driving.</P>\\r\\n<P>â€œWe were informed that the authorised driver was among the passengers,â€ Majodina said. Both the unauthorised driver and the authorised driver, who had been sitting in the front passenger seat, had jumped out the taxi before it rolled down the embankment.</P>\\r\\n<P>The dead were named as: Thamsanqa Libaza, 43, a Tlokweng teacher; his niece Nonyaniso Libazi, 27; sisters Nomguyo and Nuku Magau, aged 53 and 55; their niece Asanda Magau, 17, a Grade 11 pupil; David Sediyane, 17, a Grade 11 pupil; Mulelekeng Lethoba, 16, a Grade 11 pupil; Makgoso Pokela, 50, and Maphadima Mile, 60.<BR>Two other people died during a hit-and-run accident in Chatty, Nelson Mandela Bay, on Saturday night. They were knocked over by a speeding vehicle while standing at a pedestrian crossing.<BR>It is alleged the driver ran away when his car finally stopped more than 200m from the scene.</P>\\r\\n<P>An unidentified man burnt to death on Saturday after a head-on collision with a truck on the N6 between Cathcart and Stutterheim.<BR>Machaea said the truck had overturned, but the occupants had not been hurt. In another incident, two young women were killed in an accident along the N2 near the Walter Sisulu University in Butterworth on Saturday afternoon.<BR>Police spokesman Captain Jackson Manatha said a bakkie had allegedly driven into the back of a Toyota Tazz.</P>\\r\\n<P><BR>â€œThe women in the Tazz died instantly. They were 17 and 21,â€ Manatha said. In Mangweni Location, outside Butterworth, a 78-year-old woman died after being hit by a car.

Not only that, the IT specialist, wife and mother of three is using the internet and a newly published book,<I> Brutal Honesty</I>, to encourage others to â€œlive for the nowâ€.<!--blurb0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->â€œOne thing I noticed when I was diagnosed was a lack of a South African network of people who understood what I was going through,<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->â€œAn international blogging network helped me, but I always felt people needed something closer to home.â€<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->Kohler was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2006 and started reaching out to other sufferers during her treatment in 2008.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->She started a blog (www.kohlerprojects.blogspot.com) talking candidly about her diagnosis and three- pronged treatment: radiation therapy, chemotherapy and medication.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->â€œI found it hard to communicate what I felt during this time and writing my thoughts down just made it a little easier,â€ she said last week.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->Kohler continued the blog after recovering from her tumour, showing her followers how she kept on living through international travel, painting and even opening a coffee shop.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->Family oriented Kohler credits her husband, James, parents Alan and Lynn Page, her siblings and her three children: 15-year-old Anastasia, 13-year-old Adam and four-year-old Leo with speeding up her healing process. Seeing what her family went through made her want to find out how other families dealt with a similar situation.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->Her answer came in the form of an American, Dan Oâ€™Connor, whose wife Sandy died from a brain tumour shortly after Kohlerâ€™s diagnosis. Over three years of correspondence, Kohler and Oâ€™Connor discussed death and living with a brain tumour. â€œWe have become good friends and have been able to show each other the other side of the situation.â€<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->Interest in her blog and her correspondence with Oâ€™Connor led to Kohlerâ€™s decision to convert the blog into a book which was launched in the metro last weekend.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->â€œI am not an expert â€“ Iâ€™m just someone who has been through it, so I wanted to share my story. The book features a cover picture, taken by my mother, showing the scar left by the brain surgeries. This just symbolises how far Iâ€™ve come.â€<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->Kohler was diagnosed with a benign brain tumour after the birth of her third child.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->â€œI would have these moments where it felt like I had a net pulled over my face. I couldnâ€™t focus or communicate with people.â€<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->During the pregnancy doctors thought her blackouts were caused by high blood pressure, but an examination after Leoâ€™s birth revealed a tumour. â€œLooking back, I had symptoms for probably four years before then, such as headaches, fainting, forgetfulness.â€<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->A year and a half after diagnosis Kohler was told she only had six months to live if the tumour was not removed. â€œMy tumour was seven centimetres large and was pushing the entire left side of my brain.â€<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->She and her husband went to Cape Town for the procedure and after three operations she started radiation therapy in December 2008.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->The beautiful blonde lost her hair during this treatment. After radiation Kohler underwent chemotherapy.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->She still suffers from headaches and problems with memory and is on chronic medication to stop seizures, but her hair has grown back and is now cut into a elegant bob.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->Kohler is in the process of starting an online support group which she hopes will lead to groups which meet in person. â€œI want to set up something where people can see they are not alone, and hear stories with a happy ending.â€<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->She is involved with the United Kingdom based group, Brain Tumour buddies, and hopes to start a South African version of their â€œbehind the maskâ€ exhibition which features radiotherapy masks decorated by brain tumour survivors.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->â€œMany people tend to look at (brain tumours) like a death sentence ...

Scarves and stretchy fishermanâ€™s-rib knits make me feel at home; I thrive in sub-zero temperatures calling for stripy beanies and canoodles under electric blankets.</P>\\r\\n<P>A student psychologist friend recently suggested that my seasonal habits were the natural result of an unresolved â€“ and suspiciously negative â€“ past relationship. She was right.<BR>As with many (if not all) women, my most intimate relationship is with my body. The bald truth is that we are grossly incompatible.</P>\\r\\n<P>Why we ever hooked up in the first place is beyond me. Weâ€™ve broken up over the silliest of spats â€“ a second helping of chocolate ganache cake, defiantly dimply thighs and a stubborn refusal to budge post-baby weight.</P>\\r\\n<P>Maddeningly, when I throw in the towel and storm out of the room, my body follows.

8.15pm.<BR>Yesterday, Maritzburg lost their hot-headed coach Ernst Middendorp two minutes before half-time when he was sent off the bench by referee Daniel Bennett as tempers and tension exploded after Bucsâ€™ second goal.</P>\\r\\n<P><BR>To make it worse, Bennett showed midfielder Felix Obada the red card in the 82nd minute after he elbowed Piratesâ€™ Clifford Ngobeni in the face.<BR>Before the match, Middendorp and club management wer</P>\\r\\n<P>e upset with the PSLâ€™s decision to deny the club home ground advantage by playing the match at the Chatsworth Stadium instead of the Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg.<BR>The reason given to United was the Harry Gwala Stadium was not â€œsafe enoughâ€ for the Knockout semi-final.</P>\\r\\n<P>However, the two teams will meet at the Harry Gwala Stadium in an Absa Premiership match on Friday night and there are no safety concerns for that clash. Middendorpâ€™s game plan was to put the Buccaneers under pressure from the kick-off.<BR>His players dominated the opening spell, but went a goal down in the 19th minute to a sucker punch when Dikgang Mabalane slotted home from close range after a Thulasizwe Mbuyane cross was helped on to Mabalane by Daine Klate.<BR>Pirates delivered the killer blow when Elena Otorugu headed home an inch-perfect cross from Mabalane in the 43rd minute to make it 2-0.</P>\\r\\n<P>The goal so incensed Middendorp that he lost his cool. Bennett sent the angry coach from the bench after an angry outburst against the referee.<BR>He had to watch the rest of the game from the stands.<BR>Middendorp was angry at Bennettâ€™s failure to punish a â€œdiveâ€ inside the penalty area from Otorugu seconds before he scored.</P>\\r\\n<P>In the 27th minute, United midfielder Kurt Lentjies was booked for diving inside the Bucsâ€™ area. That booking and the goal were enough to light Middendorpâ€™s short fuse.<BR>Bucs went for the kill and tried to finish off the game early in the second half and nearly got a third goal, but Rooi Mahamutsaâ€™s shot went wide in the 48th minute.<BR>Maritzburg kept fighting and almost reduced the deficit, but Mor Dioufâ€™s powerful 20-metre free kick shaved the upright.<BR>To add insult to injury, in the 87th minute Diouf, in trying to clear Bucs substitute Tlou Segolelaâ€™s cross, steered the ball into his net for a spectacular own goal to make it 3-0. â€“ Sapa</P>\'\r\n			)\r\n		'),(192,1,'admin','2010-11-23 10:20:06',7,'\r\n			insert into news (categoryid, title, author, metatitle, metakeywords, metadescription, newsdate, newsdateend, shortdesc,tags, article) \r\n			values(\r\n				9,\r\n				\'La Femme and Reach for a Dream\',\r\n				\'La Femme\',				\r\n				\'La Femme and Reach for a Dream\',\r\n				\'\',\r\n				\'\',\r\n				\'2010/11/23\',\r\n				NULL,\r\n				\'La Femme and Reach for a Dream are asking girls to enter their matric dance dress for Wear Your Dream, a competition to raise funds for the Port Elizabeth branch of the Reach for a Dream Foundation.\',\r\n				\'\',				\r\n				\'<P>La Femme and Reach for a Dream are asking girls to enter their matric dance dress for Wear Your Dream, a competition to raise funds for the Port Elizabeth branch of the Reach for a Dream Foundation.</P>\\r\\n<P>The competition is now open, entries close on October 19 and the competition culminates in a gala event to be held at the Edward Hotel in November.</P>\\r\\n<P>A panel of judges will sift through photographic entries in three categories, which are:<BR></P>\\r\\n<P><B>Bought:</B> Dresses bought from a retailer fall into this category.

Since then she has travelled to five countries, taken up painting and opened a coffee shop. Not only that, the IT specialist, wife and mother of three is using the internet and a newly published book,<I> Brutal Honesty</I>, to encourage others to â€œlive for the nowâ€.<!--blurb0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->â€œOne thing I noticed when I was diagnosed was a lack of a South African network of people who understood what I was going through,<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->â€œAn international blogging network helped me, but I always felt people needed something closer to home.â€<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->Kohler was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2006 and started reaching out to other sufferers during her treatment in 2008.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->She started a blog (www.kohlerprojects.blogspot.com) talking candidly about her diagnosis and three- pronged treatment: radiation therapy, chemotherapy and medication.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->â€œI found it hard to communicate what I felt during this time and writing my thoughts down just made it a little easier,â€ she said last week.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->Kohler continued the blog after recovering from her tumour, showing her followers how she kept on living through international travel, painting and even opening a coffee shop.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->Family oriented Kohler credits her husband, James, parents Alan and Lynn Page, her siblings and her three children: 15-year-old Anastasia, 13-year-old Adam and four-year-old Leo with speeding up her healing process. Seeing what her family went through made her want to find out how other families dealt with a similar situation.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->Her answer came in the form of an American, Dan Oâ€™Connor, whose wife Sandy died from a brain tumour shortly after Kohlerâ€™s diagnosis. Over three years of correspondence, Kohler and Oâ€™Connor discussed death and living with a brain tumour. â€œWe have become good friends and have been able to show each other the other side of the situation.â€<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->Interest in her blog and her correspondence with Oâ€™Connor led to Kohlerâ€™s decision to convert the blog into a book which was launched in the metro last weekend.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->â€œI am not an expert â€“ Iâ€™m just someone who has been through it, so I wanted to share my story. The book features a cover picture, taken by my mother, showing the scar left by the brain surgeries. This just symbolises how far Iâ€™ve come.â€<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->Kohler was diagnosed with a benign brain tumour after the birth of her third child.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->â€œI would have these moments where it felt like I had a net pulled over my face. I couldnâ€™t focus or communicate with people.â€<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->During the pregnancy doctors thought her blackouts were caused by high blood pressure, but an examination after Leoâ€™s birth revealed a tumour. â€œLooking back, I had symptoms for probably four years before then, such as headaches, fainting, forgetfulness.â€<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->A year and a half after diagnosis Kohler was told she only had six months to live if the tumour was not removed. â€œMy tumour was seven centimetres large and was pushing the entire left side of my brain.â€<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->She and her husband went to Cape Town for the procedure and after three operations she started radiation therapy in December 2008.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->The beautiful blonde lost her hair during this treatment. After radiation Kohler underwent chemotherapy.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->She still suffers from headaches and problems with memory and is on chronic medication to stop seizures, but her hair has grown back and is now cut into a elegant bob.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->Kohler is in the process of starting an online support group which she hopes will lead to groups which meet in person. â€œI want to set up something where people can see they are not alone, and hear stories with a happy ending.â€<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->She is involved with the United Kingdom based group, Brain Tumour buddies, and hopes to start a South African version of their â€œbehind the maskâ€ exhibition which features radiotherapy masks decorated by brain tumour survivors.<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->â€œMany people tend to look at (brain tumours) like a death sentence ... I just want people to know that life does not stop with the diagnosis.â€<!--par0--></P>\\r\\n<P><!--par1-->Get in touch with Kohler at deirdre@greenvalleyestate.co.za.<!--par0--></P>\'\r\n					 where

the council has appealed to the Local Government, Rural and Urban Development Ministry to encroach into nearby farms for burial space, Zimbabweâ€™s Herald Online reported today (November 25).<BR>According to minutes from the education, health, housing and licensing committeeâ€™s last meeting: â€œThe committee enquired on progress regarding the use of a farm after Hunyani River and another in Mt Hampden, for cemeteries.â€<BR>There is no room for expansion of the existing cemeteries, as surrounding land is understood to have been earmarked for residential purposes.<BR>Urban planners have increasingly advocated the cremation option but this lobby has had little traction due to cultural reasons.<BR>Town planner Percy Toriro said: â€œFrom a sustainability point of view

This information is used for internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors and for traffic audits. This information (as well as information from third-party market researchers), on an aggregated, anonymous basis, is provided to advertisers advertising on the Web Site. Should You provide personal information online as part of an online advertising promotion or in order to access a third party service, such information may be provided directly to the advertiser or the third party concerned;<BR>5.2.3&nbsp; Promotions: many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors or third parties. When You request more information about a particular promotion, Your e-mail address may be shared with the sponsor of that promotion;<BR>5.2.4&nbsp; Online shopping: if You make a purchase from an online store or merchant, the information obtained during Your visit to those stores (including tracking information, cookies, credit card number and contact information) is provided to the merchants. This is to enable transactions to take place;<BR>5.2.5&nbsp; Marketing purposes: if You expressly consent to us using your personal information for marketing purposes, You agree that the Owner may, from time to time, share Your personal information with any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, holding companies, partners, or third-party providers for the purposes of sending You marketing-related announcements related to the products, goods and/or services made available by the Owner on the Web Site. You may at any time opt out of receiving such marketing-relating announcements;<BR>5.2.6&nbsp; Third parties: online merchants providing services in association with the Owner have separate privacy and data collection practices. You agree that the Owner has no responsibility or liability for third party policies. For more information regarding the merchant, their store, and their privacy policies, return to that storeâ€™s home page and click on the appropriate link;<BR>5.2.7&nbsp;&nbsp; Editorial purposes: Your personal information may be used by the Owner for editorial purposes. For example, this may include information You provide during an online survey conducted by our editors.<BR>5.2.8&nbsp; Legal: the Owner may also disclose Your personal information in special cases, where the Owner has reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against a party who may be breaching the Terms and Conditions or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the Owner\\\'s rights or property, other users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; and<BR>5.2.9&nbsp; For statistics and advertisement purposes: the Owner may perform statistical analyses in order to measure interest in the various areas of the Web Site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers have seen or \\\"clicked\\\" on their advertising banners. The Owner also uses demographic information to allow advertising banners on the Web Site to be targeted, in aggregate.</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>6.&nbsp;What are cookies and how are they used? </STRONG></P>\\r\\n<P>6.1&nbsp; Cookies are pieces of information a Web Site transfers to a userâ€™s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make surfing the web easier for You by saving Your preferences and, tracking Your online habits, traffic patterns, and making sure You do not see the same advertisement too often. The use of cookies is an industry standard.<BR>6.2&nbsp; The Owner may place a \\\"cookie\\\" on Your browser to store and sometimes track information about You.<BR>6.3&nbsp; While most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, You can reset Your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Please, note that some parts of the Web Site will not function properly if You refuse cookies. You may occasionally get cookies from third party advertisers. The Owner does not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party advertisers is an industry standard.</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>7.&nbsp;Use of IP Address An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer whenever it is connected to the Internet. The Owner also logs IP addresses, or the location of computers on the Internet. The Owner collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of the Web Site. The Owner does not ordinarily link IP addresses to personal information, which means that Your session may remain anonymous. However, the Owner cannot guarantee that this will always be the case. For example, it may be necessary to identify a particular user when it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Terms and Conditions or to protect our service Web Site, customers or other interests.</STRONG></P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>8.&nbsp;Security The importance of security for all personal information associated with You is of the utmost concern to us. While the Owner exercises great care in providing secure transmission of Your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. The Owner cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to, or from the Owner\\\'s Web Site. </STRONG></P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>9.&nbsp;E-Mail The Owner may periodically send e-mails to You

cemeteries are virtually full and the council has appealed to the Local Government, Rural and Urban Development Ministry to encroach into nearby farms for burial space, Zimbabweâ€™s Herald Online reported today (November 25).<BR>According to minutes from the education, health, housing and licensing committeeâ€™s last meeting: â€œThe committee enquired on progress regarding the use of a farm after Hunyani River and another in Mt Hampden, for cemeteries.â€<BR>There is no room for expansion of the existing cemeteries, as surrounding land is understood to have been earmarked for residential purposes.<BR>Urban planners have increasingly advocated the cremation option but this lobby has had little traction due to cultural reasons.<BR>Town planner Percy Toriro said: â€œFrom a sustainability

suspended municipal managers was slammed by Local Government Minister Sicelo Shiceka yesterday.<BR>And he revealed that he would be asking the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality to explain its decision to give former municipal manager Graham Richards a golden handshake of almost R3-million.<BR>Shiceka said in Pretoria that giving golden handshakes was the easiest way for municipalities to get rid of officials &#8211; but it was taxpayers&#8217; money that ought to be used for service delivery.<BR>The practice was flawed in principle and was crippling municipal finances. Officials under investigation for maladministration and mismanagement should clear their names before being paid out, Shiceka said.<BR>Richards&#8217;s case is similar to that of suspended Tshwane manager Kiba Kekana, who was given a R2.3-million golden handshake.\'\r\n					 where newsid = 28'),(2686,1,'webadmin','2010-12-01 11:42:56',0,'update permalinks SET permalink = \'Newdigitalera\' where

</P>\\r\\n<P>Werner Lourens is used to being mobbed by chocaholics for his skills with the cacao bean and now he has started to make the most incredibly delicious ice-cream.<BR>La Femme sampled it at Walmer Park Shopping Centre&#8217;s food fair the other weekend and decided it was worth making a trip to 50 Westbourne Road, where he runs&nbsp; Starburst Deli (cakes and chocolates of distinction).<BR>Now, you get ladies who lunch .. and then you get madams who munch. The team at La Femme fall in the latter category because they have a love affair with food that is more intense than that between Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal.<BR>So, in the interest, dear reader, of saving you both calories and cash, here is a hit list of La Femme&#8217;s favourite spots for ice-cream &#8211; or gelato as the sensual Italians call it &#8211; this summer:<BR></P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>1. Starburst Deli in Westbourne Road, Central</STRONG><BR>Werner has just acquired a slab of marble, that is chilled, on which he makes marble slab gelati &#8211; and you have to taste it to believe it.<BR>Lindt chocolate, summer berries, hazelnut and &#8220;chunky monkey&#8221; (Werner&#8217;s take on rocky road) are just the start ... so expect many new flavours as summer unfurls its hot sticky fingers.<BR>He also makes Belgian waffles and soon will be joined by two young sushi chefs so you can enjoy savoury and sweet in the same spot, where Memories Coffee Shop has been. Watch this space!</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>2. Nanaga Farm Stall <BR></STRONG>Creamy, flavourful, delicious ... the only drawback is the 50km drive to get there from Port Elizabeth. Either enjoy on the spot or remember to pack cooler bags and ice packs.</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>3.&nbsp;Lecca il Gelato at Our Superspar in Main Road, Walmer<BR></STRONG>This may be the only place in the Eastern Cape that you can buy the Cape Town based Lecca il Gelato, which is couriered up from George each day. Expensive (and the flagship pistachio is the priciest) but delicious.</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>4. The Ice Palazzo in Plettenberg Bay<BR></STRONG>German ice-cream maker Daniela Hausser knows her stuff and in season the tiny shop in the centre of town buzzes. A lovely range of sundaes and concoctions make this a summer holiday treat-stop.</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>5. Il Gelato, available at both the Bridge and Walmer Park<BR></STRONG>The Ferrero Rocher is not to be sniffed but the handful we&#8217;ve tried are all pretty tasty but still, Il Gelato ranks only No 5 on La Femme&#8217;s list (we like that you can buy a &#8220;bambino&#8221; scoop for R8, though).<BR></P>\\r\\n<P>Each and every one of these artisanal ice-creams are much more delish than the frozen shaving foam you&nbsp; buy in a wrapper at the supermarket.<BR></P>\\r\\n<P>But what if you are not flush enough to buy chi-chi gelato at all? Support your local dairy and buy the good value two-litre tubs of ice cream from Bushy Park factory shops in Perridgevale and Walmer. </P>\\r\\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\'\r\n					 where newsid = 38'),(3155,11,'Mcainshg@avusa.co.za','2010-12-03 09:38:33',0,'update permalinks SET permalink = \'icecream\' where type = \'news\' and typeid = 38'),(3156,11,'Mcainshg@avusa.co.za','2010-12-03 09:39:23',0,'update news SET categoryid = 9,\r\n								title = \'PORT Elizabeth is buzzing with new spots this summer and Richmond Hill is the beehive that is buzzing the loudest.

The team at La Femme fall in the latter category because they have a love affair with food that is more intense than that between Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal.<BR>So, in the interest, dear reader, of saving you both calories and cash, here is a hit list of La Femme&#8217;s favourite spots for ice-cream &#8211; or gelato as the sensual Italians call it &#8211; this summer:<BR></P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>1. Starburst Deli in Westbourne Road, Central</STRONG><BR>Werner has just acquired a slab of marble, that is chilled, on which he makes marble slab gelati &#8211; and you have to taste it to believe it.<BR>Lindt chocolate, summer berries, hazelnut and &#8220;chunky monkey&#8221; (Werner&#8217;s take on rocky road) are just the start ... so expect many new flavours as summer unfurls its hot sticky fingers.<BR>He also makes Belgian waffles and soon will be joined by two young sushi chefs so you can enjoy savoury and sweet in the same spot, where Memories Coffee Shop has been. Watch this space!</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>2. Nanaga Farm Stall <BR></STRONG>Creamy, flavourful, delicious ... the only drawback is the 50km drive to get there from Port Elizabeth. Either enjoy on the spot or remember to pack cooler bags and ice packs.</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>3.&nbsp;Lecca il Gelato at Our Superspar in Main Road, Walmer<BR></STRONG>This may be the only place in the Eastern Cape that you can buy the Cape Town based Lecca il Gelato, which is couriered up from George each day. Expensive (and the flagship pistachio is the priciest) but delicious.</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>4. The Ice Palazzo in Plettenberg Bay<BR></STRONG>German ice-cream maker Daniela Hausser knows her stuff and in season the tiny shop in the centre of town buzzes. A lovely range of sundaes and concoctions make this a summer holiday treat-stop.</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>5. Il Gelato, available at both the Bridge and Walmer Park<BR></STRONG>The Ferrero Rocher is not to be sniffed but the handful we&#8217;ve tried are all pretty tasty but still, Il Gelato ranks only No 5 on La Femme&#8217;s list (we like that you can buy a &#8220;bambino&#8221; scoop for R8, though).<BR></P>\\r\\n<P>Each and every one of these artisanal ice-creams are much more delish than the frozen shaving foam you&nbsp; buy in a wrapper at the supermarket.<BR></P>\\r\\n<P>But what if you are not flush enough to buy chi-chi gelato at all? Support your local dairy and buy the good value two-litre tubs of ice cream from Bushy Park factory shops in Perridgevale and Walmer. </P>\\r\\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\'\r\n					 where newsid = 38'),(3200,11,'Mcainshg@avusa.co.za','2010-12-03 10:11:21',0,'update permalinks SET permalink = \'icecream\' where type = \'news\' and typeid = 38'),(3201,2,'williamsap@avusa.co.za','2010-12-03 10:11:31',0,'update news SET categoryid = 34,\r\n								title = \'News Desks First Story\',\r\n								author = \'\',								\r\n								newsdate = \'2010-12-02 00:00:00\',\r\n								newsdateend = \'2010-12-07 00:00:00\',\r\n								shortdesc = \'Remember to tick the News Break tick box in the Article list to force a story into the breaking news column.

The team at La Femme fall in the latter category because they have a love affair with food that is more intense than that between Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal.<BR>So, in the interest, dear reader, of saving you both calories and cash, here is a hit list of La Femme&#8217;s favourite spots for ice-cream &#8211; or gelato as the sensual Italians call it &#8211; this summer:<BR></P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>1. Starburst Deli in Westbourne Road, Central</STRONG><BR>Werner has just acquired a slab of marble, that is chilled, on which he makes marble slab gelati &#8211; and you have to taste it to believe it.<BR>Lindt chocolate, summer berries, hazelnut and &#8220;chunky monkey&#8221; (Werner&#8217;s take on rocky road) are just the start ... so expect many new flavours as summer unfurls its hot sticky fingers.<BR>He also makes Belgian waffles and soon will be joined by two young sushi chefs so you can enjoy savoury and sweet in the same spot, where Memories Coffee Shop has been. Watch this space!</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>2. Nanaga Farm Stall <BR></STRONG>Creamy, flavourful, delicious ... the only drawback is the 50km drive to get there from Port Elizabeth. Either enjoy on the spot or remember to pack cooler bags and ice packs.</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>3.&nbsp;Lecca il Gelato at Our Superspar in Main Road, Walmer<BR></STRONG>This may be the only place in the Eastern Cape that you can buy the Cape Town based Lecca il Gelato, which is couriered up from George each day. Expensive (and the flagship pistachio is the priciest) but delicious.</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>4. The Ice Palazzo in Plettenberg Bay<BR></STRONG>German ice-cream maker Daniela Hausser knows her stuff and in season the tiny shop in the centre of town buzzes. A lovely range of sundaes and concoctions make this a summer holiday treat-stop.</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>5. Il Gelato, available at both the Bridge and Walmer Park<BR></STRONG>The Ferrero Rocher is not to be sniffed but the handful we&#8217;ve tried are all pretty tasty but still, Il Gelato ranks only No 5 on La Femme&#8217;s list (we like that you can buy a &#8220;bambino&#8221; scoop for R8, though).<BR></P>\\r\\n<P>Each and every one of these artisanal ice-creams are much more delish than the frozen shaving foam you&nbsp; buy in a wrapper at the supermarket.<BR></P>\\r\\n<P>But what if you are not flush enough to buy chi-chi gelato at all? Support your local dairy and buy the good value two-litre tubs of ice cream from Bushy Park factory shops in Perridgevale and Walmer. </P>\\r\\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\'\r\n					 where newsid = 38'),(3205,2,'williamsap@avusa.co.za','2010-12-03 10:13:27',0,'update permalinks SET permalink = \'icecream\' where type = \'news\' and typeid = 38'),(3206,2,'williamsap@avusa.co.za','2010-12-03 10:14:46',0,'UPDATE news SET title = \'Herald Bride and Groom\' WHERE newsid = 24'),(3207,2,'williamsap@avusa.co.za','2010-12-03 10:14:46',0,'UPDATE news SET title = \'La Femmes !st story It appears the article Title is all the text you can show on the front page\' WHERE newsid = 30'),(3208,2,'williamsap@avusa.co.za','2010-12-03 10:14:46',0,'UPDATE news SET title = \'Sports 1st story on new web\' WHERE newsid = 31'),(3209,2,'williamsap@avusa.co.za','2010-12-03 10:14:46',0,'UPDATE news SET title = \'News Desks First Story\' WHERE newsid = 32'),(3210,2,'williamsap@avusa.co.za','2010-12-03 10:14:46',0,'UPDATE news SET title = \'Clarendon Park cricket\' WHERE newsid = 35'),(3211,2,'williamsap@avusa.co.za','2010-12-03 10:14:46',0,'UPDATE news SET title = \'LARGE and lovely  but perhaps a bit shy to hit Hobie Beach in a cozzie this summer?

The team at La Femme fall in the latter category because they have a love affair with food that is more intense than that between Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal.<BR>So, in the interest, dear reader, of saving you both calories and cash, here is a hit list of La Femme&#8217;s favourite spots for ice-cream &#8211; or gelato as the sensual Italians call it &#8211; this summer:<BR></P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>1. Starburst Deli in Westbourne Road, Central</STRONG><BR>Werner has just acquired a slab of marble, that is chilled, on which he makes marble slab gelati &#8211; and you have to taste it to believe it.<BR>Lindt chocolate, summer berries, hazelnut and &#8220;chunky monkey&#8221; (Werner&#8217;s take on rocky road) are just the start ... so expect many new flavours as summer unfurls its hot sticky fingers.<BR>He also makes Belgian waffles and soon will be joined by two young sushi chefs so you can enjoy savoury and sweet in the same spot, where Memories Coffee Shop has been. Watch this space!</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>2. Nanaga Farm Stall <BR></STRONG>Creamy, flavourful, delicious ... the only drawback is the 50km drive to get there from Port Elizabeth. Either enjoy on the spot or remember to pack cooler bags and ice packs.</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>3.&nbsp;Lecca il Gelato at Our Superspar in Main Road, Walmer<BR></STRONG>This may be the only place in the Eastern Cape that you can buy the Cape Town based Lecca il Gelato, which is couriered up from George each day. Expensive (and the flagship pistachio is the priciest) but delicious.</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>4. The Ice Palazzo in Plettenberg Bay<BR></STRONG>German ice-cream maker Daniela Hausser knows her stuff and in season the tiny shop in the centre of town buzzes.

The team at La Femme fall in the latter category because they have a love affair with food that is more intense than that between Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal.<BR>So, in the interest, dear reader, of saving you both calories and cash, here is a hit list of La Femme&#8217;s favourite spots for ice-cream &#8211; or gelato as the sensual Italians call it &#8211; this summer:<BR></P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>1. Starburst Deli in Westbourne Road, Central</STRONG><BR>Werner has just acquired a slab of marble, that is chilled, on which he makes marble slab gelati &#8211; and you have to taste it to believe it.<BR>Lindt chocolate, summer berries, hazelnut and &#8220;chunky monkey&#8221; (Werner&#8217;s take on rocky road) are just the start ... so expect many new flavours as summer unfurls its hot sticky fingers.<BR>He also makes Belgian waffles and soon will be joined by two young sushi chefs so you can enjoy savoury and sweet in the same spot, where Memories Coffee Shop has been.

The solution, in the case of kaftans, is to choose one that narrows a little at the bust-line and falls more loosely over tummies and hips - making the silhouette appear more sleek&#8221;.<BR></P>\\r\\n<P>Here are some of her top tips to remember when buying your kaftan this season:<BR>* Go for a kaftan with a deep V-neck as this creates an invisible line from your neck to your torso, creating a slimming appearance.&nbsp; <BR>*Although kaftans come in a variety of patterns and prints, curvy gals are advised to rather go for bold patterns as small detailed patterns will accentuate your size due to the high pattern repeat.<BR>*The spring/summer 2010 colour palette sees a return to key neutrals, which is great news for fuller figured women, who can use the slimming properties of monotones to give a trimming effect whilst staying on trend.&nbsp; <BR>* If you have your heart set on a kaftan in fashionably bright water-inspired blues, peach-oranges, berry shades, tropical island hues or earthy yellows, try to layer it with white, black or navy pants to stay on-trend and cleverly use the colour-breaks to split your body vertically.<BR></P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;With their versatility, kaftans are a wonderful summer staple. Wear over a swimsuit or team with a pair of black pants and a few seasonal accessories and you can go from beach babe to boho-chic in minutes&#8221; says De Clercq.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR></P>\'\r\n					 where newsid = 37'),(3785,11,'Mcainshg@avusa.co.za','2010-12-04 10:28:28',0,'update permalinks SET permalink = \'Kaftan\' where type = \'news\' and typeid = 37'),(3786,11,'Mcainshg@avusa.co.za','2010-12-04 10:28:37',0,'update news SET categoryid = 9,\r\n								title = \'Kaftans for curves\',\r\n								author = \'\',								\r\n								newsdate = \'2010-12-03 00:00:00\',\r\n								newsdateend = \'2010-12-31 02:00:00\',\r\n								shortdesc = \'LARGE and lovely  but perhaps a bit shy to hit Hobie Beach in a cozzie this summer?

The solution, in the case of kaftans, is to choose one that narrows a little at the bust-line and falls more loosely over tummies and hips - making the silhouette appear more sleek&#8221;.<BR></P>\\r\\n<P>Here are some of her top tips to remember when buying your kaftan this season:<BR>* Go for a kaftan with a deep V-neck as this creates an invisible line from your neck to your torso, creating a slimming appearance.&nbsp; <BR>*Although kaftans come in a variety of patterns and prints, curvy gals are advised to rather go for bold patterns as small detailed patterns will accentuate your size due to the high pattern repeat.<BR>*The spring/summer 2010 colour palette sees a return to key neutrals, which is great news for fuller figured women, who can use the slimming properties of monotones to give a trimming effect whilst staying on trend.&nbsp; <BR>* If you have your heart set on a kaftan in fashionably bright water-inspired blues, peach-oranges, berry shades, tropical island hues or earthy yellows, try to layer it with white, black or navy pants to stay on-trend and cleverly use the colour-breaks to split your body vertically.<BR></P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;With their versatility, kaftans are a wonderful summer staple. Wear over a swimsuit or team with a pair of black pants and a few seasonal accessories and you can go from beach babe to boho-chic in minutes&#8221; says De Clercq.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR></P>\'\r\n					 where newsid = 37'),(3787,11,'Mcainshg@avusa.co.za','2010-12-04 10:28:37',0,'update permalinks SET permalink = \'Kaftan\' where type = \'news\' and typeid = 37'),(3788,11,'Mcainshg@avusa.co.za','2010-12-04 10:28:54',99,'INSERT INTO cmsimages(typeid,type,filename,imageorder) VALUES (-99,\'news\',\'temp\',0)'),(3789,11,'Mcainshg@avusa.co.za','2010-12-04 10:28:54',0,'\r\n					UPDATE cmsimages SET \r\n					typeid = 37, \r\n					imageorder = 1, \r\n					filename = \'news_37_99.jpg\'  \r\n					WHERE id = 99 \r\n				'),(3790,2,'williamsap@avusa.co.za','2010-12-04 10:29:26',0,'update cmspage SET heading = \'About  Us\',\r\n                        uploaddate =  NOW(),\r\n                        metatitle = \'About  Us\',\r\n                        metakeywords = \'\',\r\n                        metadescription = \'\',\r\n                        filecontent = \'<H2>Meet the team</H2>\\r\\n<P>\\r\\n<TABLE style=\\\"WIDTH: 20%;

Tehran says it does not want atomic arms, but as it builds on its capacity to make such weapons, neither Israel nor the U.S. have ruled out military action if Tehran fails to heed U.N. Security Council demands to freeze key nuclear programs.</P>\\r\\n<P>Iran&#8217;s bold stance was highlighted Sunday, when it announced it had delivered its first domestically mined raw uranium to a processing facility, claiming it is now self-sufficient over the entire nuclear fuel cycle.</P>\\r\\n<P>A senior diplomat in Vienna who is familiar with the issue said the move was expected and mainly symbolic. Still, the timing of the announcement was significant in signaling just a day ahead of the Geneva talks that Tehran was unlikely to meet international demands that it curb its nuclear activities.</P>\\r\\n<P>Over two planned days, Saeed Jalili, Iran&#8217;s top nuclear negotiator, will meet with EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton, with Ashton&#8217;s office saying she will act \\\"on behalf\\\" of the U.S., China, Russia, France, Britain and Germany. In fact, senior officials for those six powers will attend and do much of the talking with Tehran.</P>\\r\\n<P>Chances of meaningful progress were low even before the assassination late last month of a prominent nuclear scientist and the wounding of another further clouded hopes of success at the talks.</P>\\r\\n<P>Jalili called the killing a \\\"disgrace\\\" for the Security Council on Saturday, claiming the attacks were linked to efforts to implement international sanctions. He did not elaborate.</P>\\r\\n<P>Still, the expected presence of Ali Bagheri reflects the importance Iran attaches to the meeting. Officials familiar with the composition of the Iranian delegation say Bagheri has a direct line to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</P>\\r\\n<P>Western officials urged Tehran to meet international concerns about its nuclear activities.</P>\\r\\n<P>Invoking possible military confrontation over Iran&#8217;s nuclear defiance, British Defense Secretary Liam Fox said Saturday that the Geneva talks need to make a serious start toward resolving the issue.</P>\\r\\n<P>\\\"We want a negotiated solution, not a military one &#8212; but Iran needs to work with us to achieve that outcome,\\\" he said. \\\"We will not look away or back down.\\\" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said it was up to Iran to restore trust about its nuclear intentions, urging it to come to Geneva prepared to \\\"firmly, conclusively reject the pursuit of nuclear weapons.\\\" But for Iran the main issues are peace, prosperity &#8212; and nuclear topics only in the context of global disarmament.</P>\\r\\n<P>\\\"Iran has not and will not allow anybody in the talks to withdraw one iota of the rights of the Iranian nation,\\\" President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said before the scheduled talks, warning the other nations at the table to \\\"put aside the devil&#8217;s temper\\\" and negotiate in good faith.</P>\\r\\n<P>Expectations are suitably low, even allowing for the fact that both sides are likely talking tough going into the talks with the purpose of maximizing their starting negotiating positions.</P>\\r\\n<P>Glyn Davies, the chief U.S. delegate to the International Atomic Energy Agency, said the talks were meant to shape conditions for \\\"a new start,\\\" even while insisting that Iran&#8217;s nuclear program \\\"has to be first and foremost on the agenda.\\\" Other officials from the four Western nations coming to the table acknowledge that the six powers are coming without a firm agenda.

Tehran says it does not want atomic arms, but as it builds on its capacity to make such weapons, neither Israel nor the U.S. have ruled out military action if Tehran fails to heed U.N. Security Council demands to freeze key nuclear programs.</P>\\r\\n<P>Iran&#8217;s bold stance was highlighted Sunday, when it announced it had delivered its first domestically mined raw uranium to a processing facility, claiming it is now self-sufficient over the entire nuclear fuel cycle.</P>\\r\\n<P>A senior diplomat in Vienna who is familiar with the issue said the move was expected and mainly symbolic. Still, the timing of the announcement was significant in signaling just a day ahead of the Geneva talks that Tehran was unlikely to meet international demands that it curb its nuclear activities.</P>\\r\\n<P>Over two planned days, Saeed Jalili, Iran&#8217;s top nuclear negotiator, will meet with EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton, with Ashton&#8217;s office saying she will act \\\"on behalf\\\" of the U.S., China, Russia, France, Britain and Germany. In fact, senior officials for those six powers will attend and do much of the talking with Tehran.</P>\\r\\n<P>Chances of meaningful progress were low even before the assassination late last month of a prominent nuclear scientist and the wounding of another further clouded hopes of success at the talks.</P>\\r\\n<P>Jalili called the killing a \\\"disgrace\\\" for the Security Council on Saturday, claiming the attacks were linked to efforts to implement international sanctions. He did not elaborate.</P>\\r\\n<P>Still, the expected presence of Ali Bagheri reflects the importance Iran attaches to the meeting. Officials familiar with the composition of the Iranian delegation say Bagheri has a direct line to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</P>\\r\\n<P>Western officials urged Tehran to meet international concerns about its nuclear activities.</P>\\r\\n<P>Invoking possible military confrontation over Iran&#8217;s nuclear defiance, British Defense Secretary Liam Fox said Saturday that the Geneva talks need to make a serious start toward resolving the issue.</P>\\r\\n<P>\\\"We want a negotiated solution, not a military one &#8212; but Iran needs to work with us to achieve that outcome,\\\" he said. \\\"We will not look away or back down.\\\" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said it was up to Iran to restore trust about its nuclear intentions, urging it to come to Geneva prepared to \\\"firmly, conclusively reject the pursuit of nuclear weapons.\\\" But for Iran the main issues are peace, prosperity &#8212; and nuclear topics only in the context of global disarmament.</P>\\r\\n<P>\\\"Iran has not and will not allow anybody in the talks to withdraw one iota of the rights of the Iranian nation,\\\" President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said before the scheduled talks, warning the other nations at the table to \\\"put aside the devil&#8217;s temper\\\" and negotiate in good faith.</P>\\r\\n<P>Expectations are suitably low, even allowing for the fact that both sides are likely talking tough going into the talks with the purpose of maximizing their starting negotiating positions.</P>\\r\\n<P>Glyn Davies, the chief U.S. delegate to the International Atomic Energy Agency, said the talks were meant to shape conditions for \\\"a new start,\\\" even while insisting that Iran&#8217;s nuclear program \\\"has to be first and foremost on the agenda.\\\" Other officials from the four Western nations coming to the table acknowledge that the six powers are coming without a firm agenda. One of them used freestyle wrestling as an analogy of what to expect.</P>\\r\\n<P>\\\"Think of this as a sort of catch-as-catch can,\\\" said the official, a senior diplomat who asked for anonymity because he was briefing The Associated Press on privileged information. \\\"I don&#8217;t think we are going to get into any kind of substantive discussions - the best we can hope for is a second round of meetings.\\\" Such caution is understandable.</P>\\r\\n<P>The last Geneva meeting of the seven nations in October 2009 appeared to put Iran nuclear talks back on track after a four-year hiatus, but Tehran and the six powers began to quibble about what was agreed on only days after they ended.</P>\\r\\n<P>Iran initially seemed to accept a plan to export 75 percent of its low-enriched uranium to be made into special fuel for a Tehran reactor making medical materials &#8212; a move that would have stripped it of much of the material it then had stockpiled that could have been turned into a bomb.</P>\\r\\n<P>But it then started putting conditions on the deal, which unraveled, deepening mistrust between the two sides.</P>\\r\\n<P>A fourth set of U.N.

evacuated Monday as floodwaters surged through towns in a swathe of New South Wales, said officials, who were bracing for more rain.</P>\\r\\n<P class=BodyP>Parts of the state\\\'s southeast were declared natural disaster areas as swollen rivers spilled into the streets and water levels continued to rise, forcing the closure of major highways, state Premier Kristina Keneally said.</P>\\r\\n<P class=BodyP>\\\"We are anticipating that there may be additional flooding and the water may still be rising here in Wagga -- and as we see over the next few days those floodwaters move westward,\\\" Keneally told reporters from the badly hit inland town.</P>\\r\\n<P class=BodyP>About 4,000 people were isolated and some 1,500 had been evacuated, according to the State Emergency Service (SES).</P>\\r\\n<P class=BodyP>A total of 34 New South Wales regions were now natural disaster zones, Keneally said, with 17 declarations issued in the past few days.</P>\\r\\n<P class=BodyP>Wagga mayor Wayne Geale said it was the worst flooding he had seen since a major downpour in 1974.</P>\\r\\n<P class=BodyP>\\\"This is getting up to a height of \\\'74, the big floods in \\\'74, (when) it actually nearly breached the levee banks,\\\" Geale told ABC radio.</P>\\r\\n<P class=BodyP>\\\"But it\\\'s not -- I think it\\\'s going to fall just short of that this time.\\\"</P>\\r\\n<P class=BodyP>State Emergency Services Minister Steve Whan said that with further rain expected later in the week, authorities would keep a close watch on the situation.</P>\\r\\n<P class=BodyP>\\\"In Wagga the levee is also looking very good but there are a lot of people that are isolated and it will be some days before at lot of the links are reopened,\\\" he said.</P>\\r\\n<P class=BodyP>About 170 soldiers had joined hundreds of SES volunteers in sandbagging and rescue efforts. Whan urged residents not to enter floodwaters, following the death of an elderly man whose car was swept away in the surge further north. There had been 68 rescues, the SES said.</P>\\r\\n<P class=BodyP>Though major levees had held and rivers failed to reach their forecast peaks, officials warned that the worst was yet to come, with fresh rains due in already sodden areas.</P>\\r\\n<P class=BodyP>There will be \\\"rain to large parts of New South Wales from Wednesday through to Friday before weakening over the northeast during Saturday,\\\" the SES said, warning that major rivers would again be in flood by week\\\'s end.</P>\\r\\n<P class=BodyP>Whan said damage estimates had already hit the \\\"tens of millions (of dollars) in some shires alone\\\" with the total likely to be significant given the large area affected.</P>\\r\\n<P class=BodyP>Crop losses were also a major issue, and Whan said the inundation was a harsh blow for farmers who had just emerged from 10 years of drought. -

The team at La Femme fall in the latter category because they have a love affair with food that is more intense than that between Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal.<BR>So, in the interest, dear reader, of saving you both calories and cash, here is a hit list of La Femme&#8217;s favourite spots for ice-cream &#8211; or gelato as the sensual Italians call it &#8211; this summer:<BR></P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>1. Starburst Deli in Westbourne Road, Central</STRONG><BR>Werner has just acquired a slab of marble, that is chilled, on which he makes marble slab gelati &#8211; and you have to taste it to believe it.<BR>Lindt chocolate, summer berries, hazelnut and &#8220;chunky monkey&#8221; (Werner&#8217;s take on rocky road) are just the start ... so expect many new flavours as summer unfurls its hot sticky fingers.<BR>He also makes Belgian waffles and soon will be joined by two young sushi chefs so you can enjoy savoury and sweet in the same spot, where Memories Coffee Shop has been. Watch this space!</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>2. Nanaga Farm Stall <BR></STRONG>Creamy, flavourful, delicious ... the only drawback is the 50km drive to get there from Port Elizabeth. Either enjoy on the spot or remember to pack cooler bags and ice packs.</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>3.&nbsp;Lecca il Gelato at Our Superspar in Main Road, Walmer<BR></STRONG>This may be the only place in the Eastern Cape that you can buy the Cape Town based Lecca il Gelato, which is couriered up from George each day. Expensive (and the flagship pistachio is the priciest) but delicious.</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>4. The Ice Palazzo in Plettenberg Bay<BR></STRONG>German ice-cream maker Daniela Hausser knows her stuff and in season the tiny shop in the centre of town buzzes. A lovely range of sundaes and concoctions make this a summer holiday treat-stop.</P>\\r\\n<P><STRONG>5. Il Gelato, available at both the Bridge and Walmer Park<BR></STRONG>The Ferrero Rocher is not to be sniffed but the handful we&#8217;ve tried are all pretty tasty but still, Il Gelato ranks only No 5 on La Femme&#8217;s list (we like that you can buy a &#8220;bambino&#8221; scoop for R8, though).<BR></P>\\r\\n<P>Each and every one of these artisanal ice-creams are much more delish than the frozen shaving foam you&nbsp; buy in a wrapper at the supermarket.<BR></P>\\r\\n<P>But what if you are not flush enough to buy chi-chi gelato at all? Support your local dairy and buy the good value two-litre tubs of ice cream from Bushy Park factory shops in Perridgevale and Walmer. </P>\\r\\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\'\r\n					 where newsid = 38'),(4564,2,'williamsap@avusa.co.za','2010-12-06 11:19:09',0,'update permalinks SET permalink = \'icecream\' where type = \'news\' and typeid = 38'),(4565,2,'williamsap@avusa.co.za','2010-12-06 11:28:07',0,'update news SET categoryid = 12,\r\n								title = \'The Herald Bride and Groom\',\r\n								author = \'\',								\r\n								newsdate = \'2010-12-06 10:00:00\',\r\n								newsdateend = \'2010-12-07 08:00:00\',\r\n								shortdesc = \'\',\r\n								tags = \'The Herald, Bride and Groom\',								\r\n								metatitle = \'The Herald Bride and Groom\',\r\n								metakeywords = \'The Herald, Bride and Groom\',\r\n								metadescription = \'\',\r\n								article = \'<P>&nbsp;</P>\'\r\n					 where newsid = 74'),(4566,2,'williamsap@avusa.co.za','2010-12-06 11:28:07',0,'update permalinks SET permalink = \'bride0612\' where type = \'news\' and typeid = 74'),(4567,2,'williamsap@avusa.co.za','2010-12-06 11:28:50',0,'update news SET categoryid = 12,\r\n								title = \'Herald Bride and Groom\',\r\n								author = \'\',								\r\n								newsdate = \'2010-12-02 00:00:00\',\r\n								newsdateend = NULL,\r\n								shortdesc = \'Nadia Moodley married Vaughn Peter Gallant at  Bethel Church of the Nazarene in Shauderville.

that are close to their hearts.\\\" The tabloid suggested that broadcasters were paying up to 1,500 pounds (2,350 dollars, 1,770 euros) a minute for footage of the 20-minute interview, the first time Kate, 28, has spoken in public.</P>\\r\\n<P>It will go towards the Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry, which William, also 28, set up with his younger brother last year to fund a number of charities focusing on young people, the environment and the armed forces.</P>\\r\\n<P>A spokesman for ITN, which owns the rights to the interview, said it gave all TV stations free access to the interview for the first 24 hours, and would continue to provide it free to all broadcasters from Commonwealth countries.</P>\\r\\n<P>\\\"ITN does not disclose exact licensing charges, but the fees

tournament in Abu Dhabi by ending a 45-year wait for Europe&#8217;s top club prize with a 2-0 defeat of Bayern Munich in the Champions League final in May.</P>\\r\\n<P>The triumph in Madrid completed an unprecedented treble of Serie A, Italian Cup and European success, and confirmed Inter&#8217;s place at the summit of the Italian game after years in the shadows of neighbours AC Milan and Juventus.</P>\\r\\n<P>The good times, however, proved short-lived.</P>\\r\\n<P>Coach Jose Mourinho jumped ship to Real Madrid in the close-season and, despite the squad largely remaining intact, his successor Rafael Benitez has struggled to sustain success at the San Siro.</P>\\r\\n<P>After 15 games of the current Italian campaign, Inter sit 10 points behind league leaders AC Milan, having already lost four times and scored just 20 goals.</P>\\r\\n<P>Benitez has been hamstrung by injuries to key players, including goalkeeper Julio Cesar, Brazil right-back Maicon and last season&#8217;s top scorer Diego Milito, but he insists they will travel to the Middle East in good heart.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;This year after the World Cup the players came back late and we immediately had to prepare

champions Internacional, who claimed their second Copa Libertadores crown with a 5-3 aggregate victory over Mexicans Guadalajara in August.</P>\\r\\n<P>Internacional won the 2006 World Club Cup, beating Barcelona 1-0 in the final in Tokyo, and they will become the first previous winners to take part in the tournament, since it was rebaptised as the club World Cup, for a second time.</P>\\r\\n<P>The two Inters will not enter the competition until the semi-final stage, however, with five other teams bidding to join them in the last four.</P>\\r\\n<P>African champions Tout

So, I really don&#8217;t want to stop playing any time soon,&#8221; she said.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;If I am competitive, then I don&#8217;t really want to do anything else. Tom Watson nearly won the Open last year at 59. I am 45, and maybe have another 14 years, who knows.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;I&#8217;m not comparing myself to Tom Watson, but if he can still be playing that well against the class of players he was playing against last year, you never know.</P>\\r\\n<P>Pace will become the first South African to win the Ladies European Tour&#8217;s Money List honour, and she is unfazed at the prospect of facing the legendary Davies.</P>\\r\\n<P>The 29-year-old said: &#8220;Of course, she is a great player. She&#8217;s won so many tournaments and she&#8217;s got all of the experience in the world.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;At the same time, I&#8217;m still on form and playing really well.

field are defending champion Korea&#8217;s world Number seven In Kyung-kim, American 15-year-old sensation Alexis Thompson, American Solheim Cup star Christina Kim, and the 2008 champion Anja Monke of Germany.</P>\\r\\n<P>While the battle for the 500 000&nbsp;euros tournament will be intense, there is also the honour of becoming European number one.</P>\\r\\n<P>That fight for the Money List crown will be between South African Lee-Anne Pace, who has won five tournaments this season from 24 events played, and English veteran Laura Davies, who has been crowned European number one seven times.</P>\\r\\n<P>Wie said she was hoping to give herself a boost before taking a holiday.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just been rehabbing, recovering. I hit some balls last week so this week I&#8217;m just going to go out there and try to play pain free,&#8221; Wie said.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;It&#8217;s really important to finish strong, so I think it would make my vacation a lot more fun if I play really well this week, just go out there and ending with a bang would be great. I did feel like I improved over the course of the season so that was good. You know, obviously little glitches here and there held me back, but hopefully, for the next year I&#8217;ll be a lot stronger mentally and physically.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;I really hope I haven&#8217;t reached my peak yet. I do feel like I have a lot more.&#8221;&nbsp; Davies, who is trailing Pace by a little over 32 000 euros, needs to finish at least third or better to stand a chance to win the Order of Merit.</P>\\r\\n<P>The Englishwoman, who has never finished outside the top-four in her three previous starts at the Majlis Course, reiterated her love for the game and said she has no plans to retire.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;I love playing golf and travelling around the world. So, I really don&#8217;t want to stop playing any time soon,&#8221; she said.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;If I am competitive, then I don&#8217;t really want to do anything else. Tom Watson nearly won the Open last year at 59. I am 45, and maybe have another 14 years, who knows.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;I&#8217;m not comparing myself to Tom Watson, but if he can still be playing that well against the class of players he was playing against last year, you never know.</P>\\r\\n<P>Pace will become the first South African to win the Ladies European Tour&#8217;s Money List honour, and she is unfazed at the prospect of facing the legendary Davies.</P>\\r\\n<P>The 29-year-old said: &#8220;Of course, she is a great player. She&#8217;s won so many tournaments and she&#8217;s got all of the experience in the world.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;At the same time, I&#8217;m still on form and playing really well. I don&#8217;t see myself worrying about her simply because I have to do what I have to do. I can&#8217;t think of how she&#8217;s going to play.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;In order for me to win the tournament, I have to do the same things that I have been doing, so that&#8217;s my goal for the week.&#8221;&nbsp;-- Sapa-AFP </P>\\r\\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\'\r\n					 where newsid = 115'),(6340,2,'williamsap@avusa.co.za','2010-12-08 10:50:03',0,'delete from news where newsid =

support he and his family have been shown.<BR>The 61-year-old spoke after facing a packed Western Cape High Court to listen to the confession of taxi driver Zola Tongo, who admitted to arranging Anni&#8217;s murder and implicating Dewani as the mastermind who paid the hitmen R15000 for their services.<BR>Yesterday, Dewani&#8217;s high-profile British publicist, Max Clifford, said

Picture: GETTY IMAGES</H5></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>Michelle Wie is hoping to make a triumphant comeback to golf as she prepares to tee up for the Dubai Ladies Masters, the season-ending event of the Ladies European Tour.</P>\\r\\n<P>Wie has been out of the game with a back injury for almost a month after withdrawing from the second round of the Lorena Ochoa Invitational last month.</P>\\r\\n<P>Among other top players in the field are defending champion Korea&#8217;s world Number seven In Kyung-kim, American 15-year-old sensation Alexis Thompson, American Solheim Cup star Christina Kim, and the 2008 champion Anja Monke of Germany.</P>\\r\\n<P>While the battle for the 500 000&nbsp;euros tournament will be intense, there is also the honour of becoming European number one.</P>\\r\\n<P>That fight for the Money List crown will be between South African Lee-Anne Pace, who has won five tournaments this season from 24 events played, and English veteran Laura Davies, who has been crowned European number one seven times.</P>\\r\\n<P>Wie said she was hoping to give herself a boost before taking a holiday.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just been rehabbing, recovering. I hit some balls last week so this week I&#8217;m just going to go out there and try to play pain free,&#8221; Wie said.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;It&#8217;s really important to finish strong, so I think it would make my vacation a lot more fun if I play really well this week, just go out there and ending with a bang would be great. I did feel like I improved over the course of the season so that was good. You know, obviously little glitches here and there held me back, but hopefully, for the next year I&#8217;ll be a lot stronger mentally and physically.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;I really hope I haven&#8217;t reached my peak yet. I do feel like I have a lot more.&#8221;&nbsp; Davies, who is trailing Pace by a little over 32 000 euros, needs to finish at least third or better to stand a chance to win the Order of Merit.</P>\\r\\n<P>The Englishwoman, who has never finished outside the top-four in her three previous starts at the Majlis Course, reiterated her love for the game and said she has no plans to retire.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;I love playing golf and travelling around the world. So, I really don&#8217;t want to stop playing any time soon,&#8221; she said.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;If I am competitive, then I don&#8217;t really want to do anything else. Tom Watson nearly won the Open last year at 59. I am 45, and maybe have another 14 years, who knows.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;I&#8217;m not comparing myself to Tom Watson, but if he can still be playing that well against the class of players he was playing against last year, you never know.</P>\\r\\n<P>Pace will become the first South African to win the Ladies European Tour&#8217;s Money List honour, and she is unfazed at the prospect of facing the legendary Davies.</P>\\r\\n<P>The 29-year-old said: &#8220;Of course, she is a great player. She&#8217;s won so many tournaments and she&#8217;s got all of the experience in the world.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;At the same time, I&#8217;m still on form and playing really well.

Picture: GETTY IMAGES</H5></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>Michelle Wie is hoping to make a triumphant comeback to golf as she prepares to tee up for the Dubai Ladies Masters, the season-ending event of the Ladies European Tour.</P>\\r\\n<P>Wie has been out of the game with a back injury for almost a month after withdrawing from the second round of the Lorena Ochoa Invitational last month.</P>\\r\\n<P>Among other top players in the field are defending champion Korea&#8217;s world Number seven In Kyung-kim, American 15-year-old sensation Alexis Thompson, American Solheim Cup star Christina Kim, and the 2008 champion Anja Monke of Germany.</P>\\r\\n<P>While the battle for the 500 000&nbsp;euros tournament will be intense, there is also the honour of becoming European number one.</P>\\r\\n<P>That fight for the Money List crown will be between South African Lee-Anne Pace, who has won five tournaments this season from 24 events played, and English veteran Laura Davies, who has been crowned European number one seven times.</P>\\r\\n<P>Wie said she was hoping to give herself a boost before taking a holiday.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just been rehabbing, recovering. I hit some balls last week so this week I&#8217;m just going to go out there and try to play pain free,&#8221; Wie said.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;It&#8217;s really important to finish strong, so I think it would make my vacation a lot more fun if I play really well this week, just go out there and ending with a bang would be great. I did feel like I improved over the course of the season so that was good. You know, obviously little glitches here and there held me back, but hopefully, for the next year I&#8217;ll be a lot stronger mentally and physically.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;I really hope I haven&#8217;t reached my peak yet. I do feel like I have a lot more.&#8221;&nbsp; Davies, who is trailing Pace by a little over 32 000 euros, needs to finish at least third or better to stand a chance to win the Order of Merit.</P>\\r\\n<P>The Englishwoman, who has never finished outside the top-four in her three previous starts at the Majlis Course, reiterated her love for the game and said she has no plans to retire.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;I love playing golf and travelling around the world. So, I really don&#8217;t want to stop playing any time soon,&#8221; she said.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;If I am competitive, then I don&#8217;t really want to do anything else. Tom Watson nearly won the Open last year at 59. I am 45, and maybe have another 14 years, who knows.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;I&#8217;m not comparing myself to Tom Watson, but if he can still be playing that well against the class of players he was playing against last year, you never know.</P>\\r\\n<P>Pace will become the first South African to win the Ladies European Tour&#8217;s Money List honour, and she is unfazed at the prospect of facing the legendary Davies.</P>\\r\\n<P>The 29-year-old said: &#8220;Of course, she is a great player. She&#8217;s won so many tournaments and she&#8217;s got all of the experience in the world.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;At the same time, I&#8217;m still on form and playing really well. I don&#8217;t see myself worrying about her simply because I have to do what I have to do. I can&#8217;t think of how she&#8217;s going to play.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;In order for me to win the tournament, I have to do the same things that I have been doing, so that&#8217;s my goal for the week.&#8221;&nbsp;-- Sapa-AFP </P>\\r\\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\'\r\n					 where newsid = 115'),(6412,15,'reevesa@avusa.co.za','2010-12-08 11:30:29',0,'update news SET categoryid = 10,\r\n								title = \'Sampras shocked by trophy theft\',\r\n								author = \'Sapa-dpa\',								\r\n								newsdate = \'2010-12-08 10:00:00\',\r\n								newsdateend = \'2010-12-09 07:00:00\',\r\n								shortdesc = \'Tennis legend Pete Sampras has revealed that a lifetime of trophies have been stolen from two locked and secured storage units, where they were being stored during a change of home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\',\r\n								tags = \'\',								\r\n								metatitle = \'Sampras shocked by trophy theft\',\r\n								metakeywords = \'\',\r\n								metadescription = \'\',\r\n								article = \'<P>Tennis legend Pete Sampras has revealed that a lifetime of trophies have been stolen from two locked and secured storage units, where they were being stored during a change of home.</P>\\r\\n<P>The 39-year-old told the Los Angeles Times the unexplained theft occurred last month in west Los Angeles.</P>\\r\\n<P>&#8220;Losing this stuff is like having the history of my tennis life taken away,&#8221; he said.</P>\\r\\n<P>But the American, who retired in 2002 with a then-record 14 Grand Slam titles, still has 13 of his trophies from the majors, which were not inside the units.
